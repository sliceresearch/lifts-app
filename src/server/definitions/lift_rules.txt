#Cognitive Load
#•	Word limit per slide exceeded
#•	Bullet points per slides exceed
 
#Visual Learners
#•	Slide deck contains no images
#•	Slides 3-6 contain no images, recommend breaking up long text content with diagrams, charts of images that visually explain your content. Leave length text content for slide notes.
 
Typography
•	Slide contains text too small to be read by students in back row of lecturer theatre
o	Slide 4 contains text with font size 3px
 
Accessibility
•	Slide contains background and foreground colours that are too visually similar.
o	People with accessibility vision issues will not be able to see your content
•	Slide contains an image without descriptive text
o	People that rely on screen readers to read your content need to have descriptive text on images to understand what the image is.
 
Spelling / Grammar
•	Slides 4,7,8 contain spelling errors
•	Slides 4,7,8 contain grammar errors
o	Might be the first rule to be turned off given slide decks use point form which is not always grammatically correct.
 
Readability
•	Slide exceeds the readability level desired for a Level 1 course
o	This could be determined via sending text ( slides/notes ) from bullet points to a Cognitive AI based service that provides textual interpretation information that could be used in rules.
